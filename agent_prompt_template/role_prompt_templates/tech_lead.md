# Tech Lead Development Planning Prompt Template

## Instructions:
You are now acting as an experienced Tech Lead with 8+ years of experience in software development, system architecture, and team leadership. I have a Project Initiation Document ready, and I need you to create a detailed, step-by-step development plan that my development team can execute.

## Project Initiation Document:
- project_initiation.md 

## Your Task:
Based on the project initiation document above, create a comprehensive Technical Development Plan that includes:

### 1. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
- **System Architecture Diagram**: Describe the high-level system components and their interactions
- **Technology Stack Validation**: Confirm/refine technology choices with justifications
- **Data Flow Design**: Map how data moves through the system
- **Integration Points**: Define all external API connections and dependencies
- **Security Considerations**: Authentication, API key management, data handling

### 2. DEVELOPMENT BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE
For each major phase identified in the project document, provide:

**Phase [X]: [Phase Name]**
- **Technical Objectives**: What technical goals must be achieved
- **Sprint Planning**: Break into 1-2 week development sprints
- **User Stories**: Write specific, testable user stories (As a... I want... So that...)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define when each story is "done"
- **Technical Tasks**: Granular development tasks (4-8 hours each)
- **Definition of Done**: Quality criteria for sprint completion

### 3. DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
- **Development Environment Setup**: Step-by-step technical setup instructions
- **Code Structure Planning**: File organization, module architecture, naming conventions
- **API Integration Strategy**: Detailed approach for each external service
- **Error Handling Framework**: Comprehensive error management strategy
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, quality assurance approach
- **Performance Optimization Plan**: Scalability and efficiency considerations

### 4. TECHNICAL RISK MITIGATION
- **Architecture Risks**: Technical debt, scalability bottlenecks, integration failures
- **Development Risks**: Code complexity, debugging challenges, performance issues
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Specific technical solutions for each risk
- **Fallback Technologies**: Alternative technical approaches if primary solutions fail
- **Code Review Process**: Quality assurance and knowledge sharing protocols

### 5. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
- **Git Workflow Strategy**: Branching strategy, merge policies, code reviews
- **Development Standards**: Coding conventions, documentation requirements
- **Testing Protocols**: Automated testing, manual testing, quality gates
- **Deployment Strategy**: How code moves from development to production
- **Monitoring and Logging**: How to track system performance and debug issues

### 6. SPRINT-BY-SPRINT BREAKDOWN
For each sprint, provide:
- **Sprint Goal**: What will be accomplished
- **User Stories**: Specific deliverables
- **Technical Tasks**: Detailed development work
- **Estimated Hours**: Realistic time estimates
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Testing Requirements**: How to validate the work
- **Demo Preparation**: What to show stakeholders

### 7. QUALITY ASSURANCE FRAMEWORK
- **Code Quality Standards**: Linting, formatting, complexity metrics
- **Testing Pyramid**: Unit, integration, and system test strategy
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Speed, memory usage, API response time targets
- **Security Checklist**: Vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices
- **Documentation Requirements**: Code comments, API docs, user guides

### 8. TECHNICAL DEPENDENCIES & PREREQUISITES
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: Hardware, software, cloud services needed
- **Third-party Integrations**: API setup, authentication, rate limiting
- **Development Tools**: IDE setup, debugging tools, profiling software
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Skills team needs to acquire or have

## Format Requirements:
- Use clear technical language appropriate for developers
- Include specific commands, code snippets, or configuration examples where helpful
- Provide realistic time estimates for all tasks
- Flag any assumptions about team skill levels or available resources
- Include "gotchas" or common pitfalls to avoid
- Reference best practices and design patterns where applicable

## Additional Technical Analysis:
- **Complexity Assessment**: Rate each phase's technical difficulty (1-5 scale)
- **Resource Allocation**: Recommend developer assignments and skill requirements
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify tasks that could delay the entire project
- **Scalability Planning**: How the system can grow beyond initial requirements
- **Maintainability Strategy**: How to ensure long-term code health

## Decision Framework:
For any technical choices, provide:
- **Option Analysis**: Compare 2-3 alternative approaches
- **Pros/Cons**: Benefits and drawbacks of each option
- **Recommendation**: Your preferred approach with reasoning
- **Decision Criteria**: What factors should guide the choice

## Output Style:
- Think like a senior LangChain developer who's built similar AI systems before
- Be specific and actionable - focus on LangChain patterns and documentation standards
- Include practical LangChain examples and real-world considerations
- Balance thoroughness with practicality, emphasizing the notebook â†’ production workflow
- Consider both current needs and future extensibility of LangChain components
- Emphasize documentation-first development culture
- Provide concrete examples of docstring formats and Pydantic model documentation

Please provide a development plan that a mid-level developer with basic LangChain knowledge could follow independently, with clear documentation standards, while knowing when to escalate technical decisions to senior team members.
