# ShortFactory Agent - Documentation

## Project Overview

ShortFactory Agent is an AI-powered video generation system that creates short educational videos from given subjects. The system consists of four specialized agents working together to produce high-quality video content.

## Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent architecture with the following components:

1. **Script Writer Agent** - Creates engaging video scripts with story structure
2. **Image Generate Agent** - Generates visual content based on script descriptions  
3. **Video Generate Agent** - Creates animated video sequences
4. **Audio Generate Agent** - Produces voice narration and sound effects

## Documentation Structure

- `project-overview.md` - Detailed project description and goals
- `architecture.md` - System architecture and agent interactions
- `google-sdk-guide.md` - Google SDK integration documentation
- `development-roadmap.md` - Step-by-step development plan with checkboxes
- `api-reference.md` - API documentation for each agent
- `deployment-guide.md` - Deployment and setup instructions

## Current Status

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Documentation framework established
